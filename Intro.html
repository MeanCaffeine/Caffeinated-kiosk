</ul>

<h1><em>Bikes and Bridges</em> is a project that explores the problems and solutions related to urban mobillity in Pittsburgh and across America.</h1>
<p>America has a car problem. For the past decade, road deaths by both drivers, bikers, and pedestrians have been skyrocketing. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, nearly 21,000 people have died. Every year, that is roughly seven times the death toll of the 9/11 Terror Attacks. That's nearly the same number as the entire freshman clas at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
<h2>It doesn't have to be this way.</h2>
<p>What I hope to acheive is to inspire change and give people hope for a better Pittsburgh of tomorow. I want to remind the people of Pittsburgh that<em> A better world is possible.</em></p>
